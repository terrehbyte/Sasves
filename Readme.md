Sasves is a wave gesture memorization game for GlobalGameJam 2017, which was themed "Waves".

# Where to play

You can play it on Android using either the *.apk in sasves.zip listed on <http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/sasves> or on the Google Play store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TerryJacobShawn.SimonWaves>

# How to play

Sasves uses your devices gyro to tell if you're waving like Simon. Try to do the same kind of wave that Simon does. First pick one of the 4 objects Simon waves with. Then wave the same way he does. Simon either waves right, left, or center. It's really hard to figure out how to play. We didn't have time for polishing the how to play aspects during the game jam. Sorry :-o
